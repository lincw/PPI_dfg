\section{Objectives and work program}

\subsection{Anticipated total duration of the project}
Financial support is requested for three years.

\subsection{Objectives}
\let\oldpara=\theparagraph
\addtocounter{secnumdepth}{1}
\renewcommand{\theparagraph}{Goal \arabic{paragraph}}

\paragraph{\textnormal{Generate a comprehensive tissue-specific PPI probability database.}}
We will produce tissue-specific probability scores for $\approx$170,000 known protein-protein interactions across 50 human tissues, creating a novel three-score framework (likelihood, confidence, concordance) that captures both biological probability and data quality.

\paragraph{\textnormal{Validate LLM-derived predictions through orthogonal evidence.}}
We will demonstrate that LLM-based biological reasoning captures functional relationships invisible to expression-based methods, validated through structural analysis (AlphaFold-Multimer) and independent pathway databases (Reactome).

\paragraph{\textnormal{Create a sustainable, community-accessible resource.}}
We will deploy an open web platform and a distilled AI model, hosted on dedicated hardware to ensure long-term availability beyond the funding period.

\subsection{Work program including proposed research methods}

The three work packages form an integrated pipeline (\cref{fig:timeline}): \textbf{WP1} generates tissue-specific probability scores using LLM-based biological reasoning and produces a distilled model for efficient inference. \textbf{WP2} validates predictions through structural analysis and extends coverage to the full proteome via a hybrid neuro-symbolic GNN. \textbf{WP3} creates a sustainable community resource with continuous literature-based updates. The requested Mac Studio workstation serves all three phases: as a high-throughput inference engine (WP1), model training platform (WP2), and long-term hosting server (WP3).

\subsection{Handling of research data}
Data generated during this project will be used for scientific publications in preprint and peer-reviewed journals. All necessary raw data will be deposited in publicly available repositories (e.g., NCBI GEO, SRA) to ensure reproducibility. Source code and analysis pipelines will be open-sourced on \textbf{GitHub}, while the trained Student Models and distilled weights will be made publicly available on \textbf{HuggingFace} to facilitate community adoption. All data management practices will adhere to FAIR principles.

\subsection{Relevance of sex, gender and/or diversity}
The project analyzes human protein interactions across male and female tissues as provided by the Human Protein Atlas, accounting for biological diversity in interactome modeling.

\section{Supplementary information on the research context}

\subsection{Ethical and/or legal aspects of the project}

\subsubsection{General ethical aspects}
The project uses publicly available, de-identified omics data and does not involve direct human or animal experimentation.

\subsubsection{Descriptions of proposed investigations involving humans, human materials or identifiable data}
None.

\subsubsection{Descriptions of proposed investigations involving experiments on animals}
None.

\subsubsection{Descriptions of projects involving genetic resources from a foreign country}
None.

\subsubsection{Explanations regarding any possible safety-related aspects}
The project focuses on computational modeling of protein interactions and does not involve dual-use research of concern.

\subsubsection{Considerations on aspects of ecological sustainability}
Computational tasks are optimized for high-efficiency hardware (Apple Silicon) to minimize energy consumption compared to traditional server clusters.

\subsection{Other information}
In submitting a proposal to the DFG, I agree to adhere to the DFG's rules of good scientific practice and FAIR principles.

\paragraph{Use of Generative Models for Content Creation}
In alignment with the DFG's "Guidelines on the Use of Generative Models for Content Creation" (September 2023 and updated 2025), we declare that generative models (LLMs) are used as core research objects within this proposal (e.g., for PPI reasoning). For the preparation of this proposal, LLMs were used for language editing and structural organization; however, all scientific claims, data interpretation, and technical designs remain the sole responsibility of the applicant.
