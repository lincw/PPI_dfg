\paragraph{WP2: Structural Validation and Genome-Scale Expansion (Year 2)}
\label{wp:2}

\textbf{Objective:} To validate the biological plausibility of LLM-derived interactions using physical structural constraints and to extend predictions to the entire proteome via a Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic approach combining Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with LLM-derived semantic features.

\subparagraph{Task 2.1: Structural Validation via AlphaFold-Multimer (Months 13-18)}
To address the lack of high-throughput experimental validation, we will implement a Physical Gate by leveraging the institute's High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Target Selection:} We will select the top 5\% high-probability tissue-specific interactions identified in WP1 (approximately 400k pairs). Priority will be given to interfaces containing known pathogenic variants (from ClinVar) to maximize clinical relevance. Negative controls will be drawn from organ-specific PPIs that are definitively non-occurring in the target tissue.
    \item \textbf{Structural Prediction:} We will deploy AlphaFold-Multimer on the HPC cluster to predict the interface physical stability, specifically analyzing pLDDT and ipTM scores.
    \item \textbf{Dual-Gating Analysis:} We will correlate the Environmental Probability with the Physical Probability from HPC structural modeling.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Task 2.2: Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Extension via Graph Neural Networks (Months 19-24)}
While WP1 covers known interactions, we aim to discover novel interactions across the entire proteome. Preliminary results across 49 tissues demonstrate that LLM reasoning captures functional relationships invisible to expression-based methods: interactions ``rescued'' by the LLM (low expression signal, high LLM score) showed 4.3-fold higher pathway validation rates than expression-only predictions. Furthermore, a hybrid approach combining GNN topology with LLM semantics outperformed either method alone in 7 of 10 tested tissues.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Heterogeneous Graph Construction:} We will construct tissue-specific Heterogeneous Graphs where nodes represent proteins and edges represent the LLM-derived probabilities. Using a heterogeneous architecture (e.g., Heterogeneous Graph Transformer) allows the model to explicitly account for distinct tissue-specific node features and edge types.
    \item \textbf{Training Strategy:} The GNN will be trained on the Student model's outputs to learn the general, transferable principles of tissue specificity. The Mac Studio transitions during this phase from high-throughput inference (WP1) to model development.
    \item \textbf{Novel Interaction Prediction:} The trained model will infer tissue-specific probabilities for protein pairs absent from HuRI and BioPlex, generating a complete predicted tissue-resolved interactome.
\end{itemize}
